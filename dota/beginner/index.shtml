			<p>Dota 2 is a great game.</p>
			<p>Problem is, there are tons of mechanics that have made their way into the game, intentionally or not, and so many of them are just unnecessary if you're starting out. It's really uncomfortable trying to learn about an advanced when you don't even grasp the basics yet!</p>
			<p>This guide will hopefully give you the bare minimum, intuitive mechanics to help you start out in the right direction.</p>



			<h3 id="bground">Background</h3>




			<p>Dota is a 5v5 game. You'll either start in the bottom left (Radiant) or top right (Dire) of the map. The place where you spawn and respawn (the fountain) will restore your Health and Mana if they aren't full, so you'll want to return there when you're low to avoid being killed.</p>
			<p><img src="/images/dota/beginner/fountain_radiant.png" id="fountainRad" width="242" height="151">  
				  <img src="/images/dota/beginner/fountain_dire.png" width="242" height="151"></p>
			<p>Near that is the ancient. Once enough towers have been destroyed, the opponent can start attacking it--if it dies, you lose.</p>
			<p>

				<canvas id="radDireAnc" width="510" height="235"></canvas>
				<script src="/js/dota/beginner/canvasAnc.js" type="text/javascript">
				//canvas context
				</script>
				<!--<img src="/images/dota/beginner/rad_ancient_orig.png">-->
			</p>
			<p>Try finding those places on the minimap by clicking them, or click <a id="reveal">here</a> to reveal.</p>

				<!--<img src="/images/dota/beginner/minimap_orig.png" id="minimapO">-->
			</p>
			<p>(The water drop-shaped thing is where you are).</p>
			<p>Lastly, don't be discouraged if you face an opponent who wrecks your team. Some experienced players make new accounts to play with their newer friends or get a new rating. The system generally does a good job of getting them out of the beginner pool quickly.</p>



			<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>



			<p>When you spawn, buy some items by right clicking them in the shop. Upon opening the shop, you'll see suggested items; if you don't click the ? above Basics. Just follow those for a while. You can also use community hero guides for more hero-specific tips.</p>
			<p><img src="/images/dota/beginner/shop_interface.png"></p>
			<p>The three important ones are Tangoes, Healing Salve, and Clarity. </p>
			<p>

				<script>
					// function target()
					// {
					// 	//alert("yay");
					// 	targetting = 1;
					// 	document.body.style.cursor = "url('/images/dota/cursors/itemEasterEggTest.png') 16 16, default";
					// }
				</script>

				<table class="itemDesc">

							<img src="/images/dota/items/tango.png" id="tangoPic" width="43" height="32">
						</td>
						<td>
							<p>Target a <a class="eeTree">tree</a> to eat it. Doing so gives you some extra health regeneration, and more importantly, you don't lose the regen if you take damage.</p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<img src="/images/dota/items/salve.png" id="salvePic" width="43" height="32">
						</td>
						<td>
							<p>Target yourself. Doing so gives you a lot of health regen, but if you take damage, you lose the regen.</p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<img src="/images/dota/items/clarity.png" id="clarityPic" width="43" height="32">

						<td>
							<p>Target yourself. Doing so gives you some extra mana regeneration, but if you take damage, you lose the regen.</p>
						</td>

					</tr>

			</p>

			<p>For more information on starting items, click <a>here</a>.</p>
			<h4 id="shopping">Shopping</h4>

			<p>Starting out, you're going to want to use the suggested items. Besides just being good for beginners, it also means you don't have to search the shop interface for the item you want.</p>
			<p>If you left click an item, there will be a <a class="eeTree">tree</a> (see above) that shows you what other items you need to make it. Simply right click an item to buy it. If you're in the fountain and you have inventory space, it will go into your inventory. If you aren't in base, it will go into your stash, and you can pick it up when you return.</p>

				<script>
				var treeText = document.getElementsByClassName("eeTree");

				//if (recentlyClicked == "tangoPic")
				{
					
					
					treeText[0].onclick = coolThing;
					treeText[1].onclick = coolThing;
				}

				function coolThing()
				{
					if (recentlyClicked == "tangoPic")
					{
						alert("easter egg");
					}
					
				}
					// var canvas3 = document.getElementById("tango");
					// var context3 = canvas3.getContext("2d");
					// var tangoImg = new Image();

					// tangoImg.onload = function()
					// {
					// 	context3.drawImage(tangoImg, 0, 0, 43, 32);
					// };
					// tangoImg.src = "/images/dota/items/tango.png";


				</script>

			
			<p>Unfortunately, not all items can be bought from the fountain. There are two secret shops, one for each side. On the minimap, the Radiant secret shop is just right of the top tier 1 tower, and the Dire secret shop is below the mid tier 2 and to the right of the mid tier 1. Their icon is a small beige rectangle. If you try to buy an item that requires the secret shop, two yellow !s will appear on the minimap as well.</p>
			<p>Try finding the secret shops on the map by clicking them, or click <a id="revealSecret">here</a> to reveal.</p>

			<p>They are a bit out of the way, but luckily there is an animal courier that will bring you your items. After 3 minutes, it can be upgraded to fly, making it faster and able to go over terrain. Near the bottom of the left column in the shop, they are the donkeys.</p>
			
			<p>Be careful, as the opponent can kill it.</p>
			<p>Luckily there are three buttons near the bottom right that make it easy to use the courier.</p>
			
			<p>The first one selects the courier for you. After clicking it, you can move it to the secret shop to buy the item for you!</p>
			<p>The second button tells the courier to pick up items in your stash (if you have any) and deliver all your items to you. This allows you to receive your items even if you aren't in the fountain. You can send the courier to the secret shop, buy your item, and then press this button to have it delivered to you.</p>
			<p>The last button makes the courier faster for a short period of time. It's useful if you have to fly the courier over dangerous areas.</p>
			<p>Initially don't worry about using the courier to deliver your items if it seems like a lot of trouble. Micro is hard to grasp when you first start out and it's perfectly fine to go back to base to get your items. After you feel comfortable with the map and controlling your own hero, however, it is highly advisable to learn how to use the courier, because it's a staple item at all levels of play.</p>

			<h4 id="toLane">To the Lane!</h4>



			<p>Now, go walk to any lane. It doesn't matter which one, but generally you only want one person in the middle. They are also named intuitively: mid for the middle, bot for the lanes going toward the bottom, and top for the lanes going toward the top. Try out all three so you can familiarize yourself with the map. </p>
			<p>

				<img src="/images/dota/beginner/minimap_lanes.png">
				<!--<canvas id="lanes" width="209" height="205"></canvas>-->

				<script>
					// var canvas4 = document.getElementById("lanes");
					// var context4 = canvas4.getContext("2d");
					// var mmImg = new Image();

					// mmImg.onload = function()
					// {
					// 	context4.drawImage(mmImg, 0, 0, 209, 205);
					// };
					// mmImg.src = "/images/dota/beginner/minimap_lanes.png";
				</script>
			</p>
			<p>You'll pass some towers on the way. These automatically attack enemies if they get close, so you can stay somewhat safe.</p>

			<h4 id="inLane">In the Lane</h4>

			<p>
				When the clock reaches 0:00, creeps will spawn near your base and walk along the lanes. Eventually, they'll meet up with the enemy creeps and start attacking each other.
			</p>

			<p><img src="/images/dota/beginner/clock.png"> <br /> <img src="/images/dota/beginner/creeps_fighting.png"></p>

			<p>When an enemy creep dies, you'll get experience if you're within range. It's pretty big, so you don't need to hug them.</p>

			<p>However, if you want gold, you need to get the last hit on the enemy. It's exactly what it sounds like: you deal the killing blow (by right clicking it). Don't be discouraged if you miss a lot. It takes a lot of practice to last hit well.</p>

			<p>For more details on last hitting and laning mechanics, click <a>here</a>.</p>

			<p>Eventually, you'll have some levels, and therefore spells. The best way to learn what they do is read the description, and then use it! </p>

			<p>There are various spells that "control" an opponent, in that they'll be slower, won't be able to move, won't be able to move or cast spells, etc. These are good at killing the opponent, especially when paired up with your lane partner. </p>

			<p>Killing the opponent is good because it makes you stronger and makes the opponent weaker. You get more gold and exp than killing creeps and the opponent loses gold! Later in the game, it takes a long time for the opponent to respawn after they die, so you can take these opportunities to kill more buildings.</p>

			<p>While laning, using your spells on an enemy that wanders too close is generally a good idea and can lead to kills, but remember if they retreat to their tower, you'll want to back off. If the enemy tower starts attacking you, just run back until you're out of range.</p>

			<p>For more information on how towers target enemies and other details, click <a>here</a>.</p>

			<p>If your opponents manage to get your health low, it's a good time to go back to base. It's a far walk, but luckily you can shorten one direction with a Town Portal Scroll.</p>
			<p>

					<tr>

							<img src="/images/dota/items/tp.png" id="tpPic" width="43" height="32">
						</td>
						<td>
							<p>Target somewhere near a tower. After channeling for x seconds, you'll appear where you targeted. You can also double click it or target the fountain to go back there. TPing is very important (click <a>here</a> for more), but until you're more familiar with the game, you can just use these for quick transportation.</p>
						</td>
					</tr>

				</table>

			</p>


			<h4 id="pushing">Pushing</h4>

			<p>At some point, your creeps should push up to the enemy tower. This is a good time to attack it with your right click, because taking down a tower gives everyone on your team gold (you also need to if you want to attack the enemy ancient). There are four "tiers" of towers, each stronger than the previous, with the outermost starting at tier 1. The previous one must be destroyed for you to attack the next one, in a given lane. So to attack a mid tier 2, you only need to destroy the mid tier 1, not bot or top. </p>
			<p>
				<canvas id="tiers" width="450" height="308"></canvas>
				<script>
					
					var canvas5 = document.getElementById("tiers");
					var context5 = canvas5.getContext("2d");
					var tierImg = new Image();

					scaleTiers = 1.5;

					tierImg.onload = function()
					{
						context5.drawImage(tierImg, 0, 0, 209 * scaleTiers, 205 * scaleTiers);
						drawStroked2(context5, "T1", 16, 4, "black", "white", 95, 128, scaleTiers);
						//87, 123
						drawCircle(context5, 88, 124, 6, 2, "#00e600", scaleTiers);

						drawStroked2(context5, "T2", 16, 4, "black", "white", 71, 145, scaleTiers);
						//64, 140
						drawCircle(context5, 64, 140, 6, 2, "#00e600", scaleTiers);

						drawStroked2(context5, "T3", 16, 4, "black", "white", 56, 161, scaleTiers);
						//43, 156
						drawCircle(context5, 50, 157, 6, 2, "#00e600", scaleTiers);

						drawStroked2(context5, "(2) T4s", 16, 4, "black", "white", 46, 180, scaleTiers);
						//37, 168
						drawCircle(context5, 38, 169, 8, 3, "#00e600", scaleTiers);
					};
					tierImg.src = "/images/dota/beginner/minimap_orig.png";

				</script>




			</p>
			<p>To attack the tier 3, you have to go up a hill. You'll notice that if you're at lower terrain, you can't see higher terrain. This gives the high ground an advantage, and yes, I will link this.</p>
			<p><img src="/images/dota/beginner/t3rax.png" width="250" height="347"> <!--cirlce it better--></p>
			<p>If you destroy a tier 3, you can attack the opponents' barracks. Destroying them actually makes your creeps in that lane stronger, with one corresponding to the ranged creeps and one to the melee creeps (note in League there is just one, and it's called an inhibitor, which is more accurate).</p>
			<p>These powered up creeps give your team a good advantage, so often times it's safer to back up after killing one or both rax.</p>


			<h3 id="jung">Other Parts of the Map</h3>


			<p>As you probably noticed, lanes are only a small area of the whole map. On the way bot for Radiant, or top for Dire, there's an area called the jungle. There are many camps of neutral creeps that you can kill for gold and exp. However, it is difficult for most heroes at early levels, and not suitable for some heroes in general. So, starting out a good benchmark is waiting until 25 or 30 minutes before trying to kill camps. If there are no units (no creeps, no heroes) near the camp at each minute mark, new creeps will spawn.</p>
			<p>These camps are located in the small clearings and indicated with small triangles on the minimap. secret shops</p>
			<p><!--[minimap with jungle (creeps spawned), runes, rosh]--></p>
			<p>One of the exits of each jungle leads to the rune spots--one near the top left and one near the bottom right of the river. Every even-numbered minute, a rune will spawn at each of these. There are seven different ones in total, and give a variety of buffs. Honestly, it's a good idea to pick up the one closer to your lane every two minutes so you can get an idea of what they do, but remembering to do so comes with time.</p>
			<p>Near the bot rune, there's a cave. You can't actually get vision of what's inside unless you enter. Inside is Roshan, a boss-like neutral creep. Upon killing him, he gives the team gold and drops an Aegis of the Immortal, which anyone can pick up. This item revives the holder if they die, but disappears after 5 minutes. 3-6 minutes later, Roshan respawns.</p>
			<p>Later in the game, the Aegis is a powerful tool, so you can try taking Roshan with your team when opponents are respawning or far away. At early levels Roshan is usually hard to kill, and can be dangerous if the opponent comes, so it's not a bad idea to leave him alone.</p>

			<h3 id="hotkeys">Hotkeys</h3>
			<p>I don't think the default hotkey templates are very good. First of all, most of them use qwedfr as abilities. Generally, you want your hand to rest over these (qwer) so you can react by casting a spell without fumbling (also your fingers aren't spread all over the keyboard, nice for reducing stress). That would be fine if the only thing you do is cast spells. However, you also want item hotkeys, attack move, stop, control groups, etc. as you get more experienced. This basically means you'll be using the zxcvbn row as well, but then you have to move your fingers two rows.</p>
			<p>What I suggest is using asd(cv)f for abilities, which happens to be the home row. First of all, this is one way people are taught to type, so if that's you, this is probably more comfortable. Second, the physical keyboard rows are are usually staggered in a way that moving up and down from the home row is easier. For example, rest your hands on qwer move your middle finger up. The most natural movement puts my middle finger between 3 and 4 on both my external and laptop keyboards.</p>
			<p>I personally only use two mouse buttons (front and back that your thumb can press), and I usually never put targeted items on them. I find that pressing them causes my mouse to shift a bit and makes targeting a bit uncomfortable. However, some people don't have this problem.</p>
			<p>For the rest of the hotkeys, it's best to try out different combinations. Note that Alt + hotkey is a separate hotkey that you can use to minimize finger stretching. My setup is as follows:</p>
			<p>
				<table id="hotkeys">

			<p>If you use non-American keyboards or a different layout, you can also consider using hotkeys by location.</p>
			<p>One thing I highly recommend is binding select hero to a very easily accessible key, like space. As a beginner, you can double tap it to center the camera back on yourself--useful if you get lost. As you gain more experience, you will want to look around the map a lot, so having a quick and easy way to get back to your hero is nice.</p>
			<p>Lastly, a bit on quickcasting. For me, there are certain spells that I prefer using quickcast on. They're the "clutch" spells, like Dazzle's <a class="external" target="_blank">Shallow Grave</a> or Terrorblade's <a class="external" target="_blank">Sunder</a>. For example, if I'm stunned as Terrorblade, I'll put my mouse cursor over the enemy and spam Sunder, which is noticeably faster than if you have to click every time as well. Once again, this is for you to explore.</p>
