"Where to begin?" the Deltoraman mused, <br />
Replying to kiddos galore <br />
"It was long ago so you may be confused."<br />
For many aren't around anymore.<br /><br />

The legend starts on a lazy afternoon<br />
A hero with greatness in store.<br />
He would have a run in with fortune soon<br />
But trouble was straight in view<br /><br />

See, travel by boat was transportation's tune<br />
And usually safety was coo.<br />
For those travelers who were lacking gold,<br />
However, the presence of pirates was due<br /><br />

As they appeared some first-timers stood cold.<br />
Spells were fired toward the hero<br />
But he readied himself, his excitement unable to hold.<br />

They came quite swiftly, they flew through the waves <br />
Heralding the Flag of the Cards <br />
He steadied himself, the day ready to save <br />
Wielding only Fortune's shard <br /> <br />

(For the record he didn't know what it was) <br />
The travelers he would guard <br />
But in his plan there were a few major flaws <br />
Cards, not the usual type <br /> <br />

A vile group that doesn't follow pirate law <br />
Rule 1: Suffering none to slight <br />
Rule 2: Fight the defenders before taking goods <br />
Rule 3: Flag notches display might <br /> <br />

Alas the Cards, trade them as slaves they would <br />
Of course going for the others, <br />
Overpower the hero they could. <br />
