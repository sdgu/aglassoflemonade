<div class="fansy" id="9">9</div><div class="hocuspocus" id="ninth">It's moments like these&mdash;figuring out the moves to reach the next hold&mdash;that the make the mental aspect of climbing for me. There's not any other activity quite like it, both the mental and physical accomplishment that comes from the entire climb, not just topping out. <br /> <br />

I've stumbled upon this great hobby, and in such a short amount of time it's already at the point where having a gym nearby is a serious consideration for my future. I can only hope that as my progress plateaus I continue to feel the same enjoyment, so that this may continue as one of the forevers.</div>

Like, when you're literally hanging on with your fingertips, it's not a cliche right? The hold only has three openings for your fingers--not even enough room for your whole phalanges. You would expect that a surface literally rougher than sandpaper would be conducive to hanging on, but no, the lubricant known as sweat could probably replace motor oil, minus the technical details. You would expect the last stretch to be easy, a cookie for your grueling work up the wall, to make the boo-boos on your knees feel better. Instead, it's more of a rude sushi roll--you don't see any, but a bite reveals that lovely airy burn in your nostrils (I personally don't mind spicy stuff in my mouth). Like how are you, who can't even make a fist at this point, supposed to pull yourself up to control the final hold? <br /> <br />
All things considered, but mostly just how you imagine your belayer would be judging you if you didn't finish (they don't actually judge you, they're really nice), you decide to go for it. Suddenly it's as if you've been studying ballet for all your life and you can support yourself--on your toes--with one foot. The only problem is you forgot grace, so the rest of your body is a bit like some mangled twigs. Those crucial inches, like 0.54% the length of the wall, suddenly mean the difference between success and failure. Your hand inches up the wall, but suddenly friction doesn't like you anymore and your other hand rips from the wall. You fall, a poorly woven basket with a poised ballerina leg, down, like 3 inches because your belayer was paying attention. Finally, with a minute of rest, the last move feels like you're Spiderman. Easy.

<div class="fansy" id="7">7</div><div class="hocuspocus" id="seventh">Duke's wall is for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Wri-kqrX80">top rope climbing</a>. This means the climber wears a harness and "ties in" to another person, the belayer, who takes up the slack as the climber ascends. When I came back from summer, I was bummed Duke didn't have bouldering. Despite literally dropping a foot if you fall, the lack of a mat that sucks your feet in when you slip leads to an unwillingness to try potentially balance-defying moves. But I found a different kind of fun in top roping: the endurance of a long climb and topping out on a higher wall.</div>

<div class="fansy" id="6">6</div><div class="hocuspocus" id="sixth">Improving at the start is fast; just two months ago I would have struggled with a climb like <a id="five" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsJIDN93tu0">this</a> (I wish I had a gopro). In the beginning I think most of the improvement comes from increased strength, which is mostly in the fingers, rather than increased skill, which encompasses feet, balance, flexibilty, etc.</div>

<div class="fansy" id="5">5</div><div class="hocuspocus" id="fifth">Each gym has a few people, "setters", who retire old routes and set new ones every few months. As a result, there aren't always new routes to climb. Despite this, going to the gym is still exciting. Eking out every bit of efficiency from a route you've already climbed is a fun mental and physical exercise: an inch less needed to reach from different feet positioning, or reducing the stress in your elbows once again from good feet. What I mean by that is, sometimes it's actually harder to have <a id="four" target="_blank" href="flagging-nicroscom.jpg">both feet</a> on the wall (and frog-legged awkward), due to balance, the angle of the wall, or the position of the holds.  This three dimensional nature of climbing makes thinking about it interesting, a fun contrast from academics. Instead of finger cramps and graphite smudges from furious writing, you get steel fingers and chalky skin. There's a lot of freedom, and finding the best options involves both feeling and thinking about them.</div>

<div class="fansy" id="4">4</div><div class="hocuspocus" id="fourth">When that day was over, as I began to fasten my <a id="three" target="_blank" href="mystuff.jpg">gear</a> together, I started feeling like my forearms were sandwiched between two planks; rotating them was just incredibly tight. Opening doors was an ordeal too, like having immovable claw hands. But I didn't mind. It was summer so I could relax most of the time. Also I think I'm one of those weird people who enjoys being sore. The twinge of an aching muscle is a reminder that says "damn you were a badass", which is even truer when you've just bested an (artificial) cliff with your swole forearms.</div>

<div class="fansy" id="3">3</div><div class="hocuspocus" id="third">That first day I went it was fairly busy. The amount of chalk dust surprised me; the mats were infused with white powder&mdash;like, it didn't clear after trying to brush it away. It wasn't gross or anything, it was just how used the gym was. My friend directed me to this "V0", which was basically a diagonally vertical crawl. Each hold was right after the previous, with plenty of room for your whole hand. These had become worn down from use&mdash;like the ground-down pips of old sandpaper. Even though the route was really easy, topping out still felt great. Below was a rainbow array of misshapen polka dots and colored tape, telling the climbers which route to follow. People were pointing to holds, jumping to holds, scrubbing holds to remove sweat, faint clouds of chalk dust falling from their hands. Meanwhile, our <a id="two" target="_blank" href="panorama.jpg">sister gym</a> in the next town is new and still pristine.</div>

<div class="fansy" id="2">2</div><div class="hocuspocus" id="second">This summer a lot of those "problems" were solved: friends really help with the inconvenience, transportation, and time. The gym we went to, Slo-Op is open 24 / 7 to members ($45 a month). There's a door to swipe your card--it's as simple as that. The fact that there haven't ever been issues is a testament to how great the community is, especially given I live in a college town. No one wants the freedom of 24 hours taken away. More to that tune, people don't judge if you're bad, they cheer encouragement when you push yourself to perform a difficult move because they want you to keep climbing. It's like those "life isn't a competition" motivational posters. Sure you can compete (and see moves like <a id="one" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Ktiei6sWeog?t=131">this</a>), but it's not the point. That's how I feel now; I want everyone to get into climbing because of how awesome it is.</div>

<div class="fansy" id="1">1</div><div class="hocuspocus" id="first">Every once in a while the thought of rock climbing used to reach into my mind. I didn't have any experience so I would just get a weird feeling in my feet, like after cardio heartbeats in my soles. I can't pinpoint exactly why I put off climbing for so long. At those times I guess it was an inconvenient activity, not having a car to get places, "not having time", the kinds of excuses you make because doing anything for the first time is hard.</div>
